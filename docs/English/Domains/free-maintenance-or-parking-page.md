#What is parking?

If you bought a domain and want to keep it, not to lose it, you indeed wish this domain to still show that it's currently parked and owned.

Parking is also excellent to not lose the SEO score in a few days. It will only show as a maintenance page on your search engine.

If you want to sell your domain, having a parked page is also a good idea to prove that the domain is still active.

At Poli Systems, we offer this parking solution for free, so that you can still keep your domain with an introductory page in front of it.  
 

# How to setup your domain

## With any DNS provider

It is quite easy. You need to setup 2 DNS records (or one). You need to add the following records to your DNS.@ or \* to point to 116.203.149.108 as an **A** record.

And if you want the IPV6 support

@ or \* to point to 2a01:4f8:c2c:21e1:0000:0000:0001 as an **AAAA** record (shorted down it's 2a01:4f8:c2c:21e1::1)

## With us

It is the same idea just in your management panel here is an example :

# What is cool about it?

Firstly, it's hosted on totally green infrastructure as it's part of one of the Poli Systems machines. It runs on a virtual machine (VDS 1 - Ryzen 9 PRO 3900).  

And the images are randomly generated "[https://picsum.photos/1920/1080](https://picsum.photos/1920/1080)". If you are in maintenance and you really need to have a downtime point to it, SEO won't rank you lower because your website went down!

# Is it really free?

Yes it is, it's totally free of charge for anyone, we have our logo on it so we are also taking this as a sponsorship!
