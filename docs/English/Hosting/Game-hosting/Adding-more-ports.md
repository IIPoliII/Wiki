# Adding more ports

If you need more ports for your hosting to have Rcon, query, dynmap, or anything.

We will provide you with more ports for free.

However, you won't be able to choose your ports, and it will be directly applied to your startup parameters. You won't be able to change them.

If you need more ports to contact our support, and if you need to remove ports also contact our support.

We know that some services need more ports, we know your game. Contact us [here](https://polisystems.ch/manager/contact.php).
