# Order informations

You are indeed concerned about order security if you want to get more information about it, you can first read [our article about it](../order-security/).

-   The delivery times are instant for your virtual machines, except if you use the bank transfer, it will be activated once we receive your payment.
-   If we don't deliver your machine instantly, it can be because of the following reasons :
    - Our fraud checking system flagged your order, we will need to review it manually.
    - The item has no stock.
    - The automatic install failed for any reason one of our engineers will automatically check it.
    - The item is manually provisioned.
-   You will be able to access a management panel once your order is activated by going in the client arena > Services > My Services and press on your service.
-   On this panel, you will be able to manage your IP, vnc, reset your machine, restart and so on.
-   You are billed every month or annually on the same date that you did the order (except the month for the monthly subscription)
-   If you don't pay, we will stop your services automatically.
-   **You have 14 days to pay your invoice. If you don't pay during this time, there is a HIGH RISK we remove your virtual machine.**
-   Even if the traffic is unlimited, we still want fair use by your side. (It's unlimited, but if you keep using 1gb/s, for example we will need to slow you down)
