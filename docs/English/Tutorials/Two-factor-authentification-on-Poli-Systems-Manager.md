# Two-factor authentication on the Manager

## What is 2FA?

**[Two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication "Two-factor authentication")** (**2FA**) is a method of adding additional security to your account. The first "factor" is your usual password that is standard for any account. The second "factor" is a verification code retrieved from an app on a mobile device or computer. 2FA is conceptually similar to a [security token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token "Security token") device that banks in some countries require for [online banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_banking "Online banking"). Other names for 2FA systems include _OTP_ (_[one-time password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password "One-time password")_) and _TOTP_ (_[Time-based One-time Password algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm "Time-based One-time Password algorithm")_).
